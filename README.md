DIGITAL GREEN APP 

Implement a solution to track userâ€™s journey for each trip taken from Village to Market. User can
start and end journey through the device. Complete route map should be shown to user during
the journey along with the path taken by him. On end of the trip, all the geo-coordinates should
be sent to server as list of dictionaries in JSON. 
E.g.
[{
"lat":"sourabh3",
"lng":"s3",
"timestamp":"s3"
},
{
"lat":"sourabh4",
"lng":"s4",
"timestamp":"s4"
}]
